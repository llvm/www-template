## What is LLVM?

LLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal of
providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both
static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then,
LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of subprojects,
many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and
open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research. Code in
the LLVM project is licensed under the "Apache 2.0 License with LLVM exceptions.

## Getting Involved

As much as everything else, LLVM has a broad and friendly community of people
who are interested in building great low-level tools. If you are interested in
getting involved, a good first place is to skim the LLVM Blog and join LLVM
Discourse. For information on how to send in a patch, get commit access, and
copyright and license topics, please see the LLVM Developer Policy.
